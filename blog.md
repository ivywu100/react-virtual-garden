### Run tests with npm test

## Day 3

### Building more infrastructure + writing more tests
  * Working on Inventory + ItemList right now, next goal is plots/gardens

## Day 7

### Added store page and trade window

  * Store page consists of store inventory, player inventory, trade window
  * Refactored item component to be reusable between player and store inventory
  * Refactored selector to differentiate player and store items
  * Trade window contains buttons to modify quantity of item being traded
  * Added LongPressButton component to continuously run the addQuantity function when holding down a button
  * Added exponential scaling to addQuantity, so that we can add up to 100000 items in about 10 seconds


Stop worrying about proper structure, just write code and see what you need along the way

TODO:

Generate multiple store types/switch between stores
Clean up ui, especially font/scaling using rem, to accommodate more screen width
Trade Window Multiselect + Total

Sort/Order Inventory by filters - itemid, alphabetical, type?
