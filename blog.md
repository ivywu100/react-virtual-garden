## Day 1

### Set up a new app using Next.js + React

### Upload to git

### Write design doc

## Day 2

### Building infrastructure/models/writing tests

### Run tests with npm test

## Day 3

### Building more infrastructure + writing more tests
  * Working on Inventory + ItemList right now, next goal is plots/gardens

## Day 4

### Add useItem functions to inventory/garden
  * Allows swapping/converting items into other forms (seed -> plant -> harvestedItem)

### Refactor code for readability

## Day 5

### Start working on ui for garden, plot component that displays the item icon

### Added placeItem function to plot


Stop worrying about proper structure, just write code and see what you need along the way

TODO:

Implement plot actions -> runs when the plot is clicked to place/harvest/repackage items

Ensure data persistence within user sessions + swapping to different pages
