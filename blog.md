# Virtual-Garden-Blog

## Day 1

### Set up a new app using Next.js + React

### Upload to git

### Write design doc

## Day 2

### Building infrastructure/models/writing tests

### Run tests with npm test

## Day 3

### Building more infrastructure + writing more tests
  * Working on Inventory + ItemList right now, next goal is plots/gardens

## Day 4

### Add useItem functions to inventory/garden
  * Allows swapping/converting items into other forms (seed -> plant -> harvestedItem)

### Refactor code for readability

## Day 5

### Start working on ui for garden, plot component that displays the item icon

### Added placeItem function to plot

## Day 6

### Create Store class which holds a list of items for sale and modifies inventories

  * See design doc
  * Created ItemStore abstract class that is extended by Store and Inventory
  * Store contains functions to specifically buy/sell things from inventories
  * Added localStorage save/load to Store, Inventory, Garden

### Refactored ui code

## Day 7

### Added store page and trade window

  * Store page consists of store inventory, player inventory, trade window
  * Refactored item component to be reusable between player and store inventory
  * Refactored selector to differentiate player and store items
  * Trade window contains buttons to modify quantity of item being traded
  * Added LongPressButton component to continuously run the addQuantity function when holding down a button
  * Added exponential scaling to addQuantity, so that we can add up to 100000 items in about 10 seconds

## Day 8

### Converted store to a context + useStore 

  * Added store, restock, reset
  * TODO: convert garden and inventory to contexts

### Added LevelSystem for garden

### Improved serialize/deserialize methods for models, better error handling

## Day 9

### Converted garden and inventory to contexts + custom hook

### Redoing item templates and moving data to a data file for ease of content creation later

### Refactored items, item templates, fromPlainObject

  * Rewrote generatePlaceholder items
  * Added functions to get the class from an item
  * Turned inventory/placed items into abstract class, implemented subtypes as classes
  * Turned inventory/placed templates into abstract class, implemented subtypes
  * Wrote tests for to/fromPlainObject

## Day 10

### Added expand/shrink row buttons

  * Can only expand to 5 + level/5
  * Can shrink to 1

### Added tests to verify save/loading of item templates

  * Still need to add tests for items

### Added plantTime to plots and time to grow to plants

  * Setup for adding grow timers to plants
  * Plot background now changes colors when plants are finished growing
  * Plants can only be harvested when enough time has passed
  * Added messages to garden to display when plants are placed/harvested

## Day 11

### Built tooltip component

  * Plots now show tooltips on hover, displaying the value of the harvested item and how much grow time is remaining
  * Added infrastructure for inventory/trade window tooltips, though the content is to be desired
  * Added tooltips for inventory items

### Reworked store restock function

  * restockTime is now set to the time when restock is ready
  * New restockInterval field to determine the new restockTime
  * Loading a store (on refresh) will immediately restock if necessary
  * If restocking does not add any items, restockInterval is not changed
  * Store now restocks properly (interval seconds after items are purchased)

### Refactored items

  * Added item interfaces to prevent circular dependencies
  * Reworked fromPlainObject to only serialize the id, name, and type, and grab all relevant data from the items.json file
  * This causes items to update automatically when the user refreshes
  * If this ever goes live service might want to force a refresh when a new patch comes out, or users will see the wrong display

## Day 12

### Refactored items

  * Added item categories (mostly used for plant families) and descriptions
  * Updated templates + interfaces to reflect this change
  * Updated id formula to reflect this change
  * Renamed harvested x to just x; sharing names is okay because we split between plants and harvested

### UI Changes

  * Added item categories to the tooltips
  * Updated StoreProvider to more easily add new items to store
  * Fixed issue with tooltips not properly updating when the page is scrolled

## Day 13

### UI Changes

  * Moved selectedItem and owner to a provider/context, allowing easier access from internal components
  * SelectedItem now sets to null if you click an already selected item
  * Added tooltips for empty plots when a blueprint or seed is selected
  * Added dropdowns for filtering inventories by subtype and category
  * Refactored store and inventory for code reuse
  * Fixed issue with inventory not updating when garden is interacted with
    * Added inventoryForceRefreshKey as a hack to the inventoryProvider, used to refresh the item list manually
  * Updated text on plot tooltips to display more useful information on remaining time/grow time


## Day 14

### Added User Class

  * Only contains username, icon, levelsystem for now
  * Levelsystem was moved from garden to user; things that gave the garden xp now give the user xp
  * Added UserContextProvider with functions to modify username and icon
  * Need to implement history/stats tracker

### Added User page

  * Garden page now displays some basic user information
  * User page now allows modification of username and icon
  * Can only select icons from the plants subtype
  * Need to improve visual layout

### Other UI changes

  * Refactored ui to use const instead of functions for all permanent elements

TODO:
Filter inventory - sort inventory by alphabet, price, category

Use redux for state management

Add selected indicator and/or make plots show what is going to be planted/placed

To get stores to autoupdate, have to store store information in a json file and pull from it for the stocklist/itemlist without destroying the existing items

Change grow time to say minutes/hours if more than 60s remaining

Generate multiple store types/switch between stores/restock store
Clean up ui, especially font/scaling using rem, to accommodate more screen width
Trade Window Multiselect + Total

Make Garden more interactive than plant all -> harvest 

Add User class

Add level requirement to plants/seeds

Add way to delete in progress plants, some sort of select delete tool

Add multiple harvests to some plants

Add crop rotation - either assign plant families or just individual plants + soil health; low soil health -> cannot be fertilized for a duration + yield reduction, high soil health -> free stronger fertilizer

Add fertilizer item - chance for double harvest, or reduce grow time. fertilizer lasts x seconds and affects any plants that start (finish?) growing during that time. or linearly diminishing effect based on time since fertilizer application

Change plant categories to better reflect common terms

Make store not able to delete items, even if they drop to 0 quantity, and modify display to say out of stock

Add toolkit - select (plant, harvest, pickup, place); delete (only in progress plants)

Store sells seeds for base price, not 2x (?), or just make it more clear what the profit margin is

Daily login bonus to prevent softlock - gives some money and a random assortment of seeds that add up to some value

Change value of slow plants so they aren't super efficient, make them high risk high reward by having high seed costs + add random events that can destroy them + fertilizer that makes them super efficient

Tooltips should not go off the screen; make them below if normally on top, or on top if normally below

Stretch Goals
Instead of expanding row/col, have the user add 1 plot at a time
This is a design flaw, not a coding one -- right now supports exponential growth when it should be linear, also easier to make iterative progress
Probably requires an entirely new ui though for the user to select their next plot location
Or don't allow buying expansions/limit it per level
Add random events/natural disasters that interact with decorations ie. scarecrows, fences
Small, medium, large stores with different restock intervals and stock limits
Item metadata migration tool
